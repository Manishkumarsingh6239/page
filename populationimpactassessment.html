                <p>Assessing the impact of population growth on various sectors</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sep_cont">
            <div class="aboutus">
                <h2 id="environmentalimpact">1. Environmental Impact</h2>
                <p>More people require more resources, which means that as the population increases, the Earth's resources deplete more rapidly. The result of this depletion is deforestation and loss of biodiversity as humans strip the Earth of resources to accommodate rising population numbers. Population growth also results in increased greenhouse gases, mostly from CO2 emissions. For visualization, during that same 20th century that saw fourfold population growth, CO2 emissions increased twelvefold. As greenhouse gases increase, so do climate patterns, ultimately resulting in the long-term pattern called climate change.
                </p>
                <h2>2. Scial Impact</h2>
                <p>The scarcity caused by overpopulation has the potential to cause serious problems that may lead to violence. Already, protests have erupted in the Middle East over the lack of water available. Just this week, protestors in Iran showed up to show they need access to clean drinking water, now. Protests like these have the potential to turn violent and have serious consequences for governments struggling to deal with overwhelming poverty and depleted natural resources. Scarce resources cause prices to rise, which disproportionally affects less-developed nations.

                    Food is another resource that is affected by an overpopulated world. Due to increasing demands brought on by population growth, any serious disruption in the global food chain can have catastrophic repercussions. The war in Ukraine caused severe hardship for many nations, especially those in the Middle East, when food exports were halted. Some nations are almost wholly dependent upon other nations for their food needs; any major domestic issue, like conflict or famine, can put millions of people in danger of starvation.</p>
                <h3>3. Economic Impact</h3>
                <p>The rapid growth in population has been driven, in part, by the advances in medical technology that are allowing people to live longer. Life expectancy has risen all over the globe, and the infant death rate has fallen. Some deadly diseases, like smallpox, have been all but eradicated, saving untold lives across the planet.  

                    The bulk of the working classes around the world live in the ever-growing urban areas. As the cities absorb more people, the demand for housing, food, and water grows. Public services need to be expanded to meet rising demand, which leads to a higher tax burden being placed on working people. The alternative is a lack of safe water, unsanitary living conditions, and malnutrition. Unfortunately, this is the case in many cities in the developing world.</p>
                    <h3>4. Impact on infrastructure industry</h3>
                    <p>The current world population of 7.6 billion is expected to reach 8.6 billion in 2030 according to the new population Division Report launched in June 2017. With roughly 83 million people being added to the world’s population every year, this is having a significant impact on the infrastructure industry not only in terms of increasing spend on infrastructure and the scale of the proposed projects.  Population growth also means that we are becoming more land constrained and also means that we need to deliver infrastructure more quickly to meet increasing demands.  It means that more projects will be built in brownfields environments raising complexity of planning and construction of major infrastructure in the areas of stakeholder management, traffic management and other key non-programme and price areas.

                        It will mean customers will need to get used to living and working in and around construction sites dealing with constant disruption, noise and frustration.  This will increasingly become a political issue for the silent majority and will continue to drive dissatisfaction with major political parties who have become distracted with retail politics and who may fail to focus on the core issues facing the public around work, transport, social cohesion and liveability.</p>
